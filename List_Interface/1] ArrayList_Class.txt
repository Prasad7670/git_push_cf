Points:
  1) The Underlined data Structure Resizable Array or Growable array.
  2) Duplicate 
  3) Insertion order is perserved.
  4) Heterogeneous objects are allowed 
  5) Null Insertion is possible.

Constructors:
  I) ArrayList al=new ArrayList();  
   // default initial capacity of ArrayList is 10. 
   // Once ArrayList Reaches its capacity a new array list will be Craeted.with (new capacity = (current capacity*3/2)+1)

 II) ArrayList al=new ArrayList(int initialCapacity);

III) ArrayList al=new ArrayList(collection c);

*Serializable , Clonable*
ArrayList and Vector Classes implements RandomAccess Interface so that we can access any random element with same speed.
Hence if our frequent operation is retrieval operation then ArrayList is the best choice.

RandomAccess
Present in java.util pacakge.
It does not contain any method and it is a Marker interfaces.
