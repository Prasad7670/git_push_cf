Points:
  1) The underlying data structure is HashTable.
  2) duplicates are not allowed.
  3) Insertion order is not preserved and all objects will be inserted
    based on hash-code of objects.
  4) Heterogeneous objects are allowed.
  5) 'null' insertion is possible.
  6) implements serializable and Clonable interfaces but not RandomAccess.
  7) HashSet is the best choice, if our frequent operation is Search operation.

Constructor:
  I] HashSet h=new HashSet(); // default initial capacity is 16.

 II] HashSet h=new HashSet(int initialCapacity);

III] HashSet h=new HashSet(int initialCapacity, float loadFactor);

 IV] HashSet h=new HashSet(Collection c);


Load Factor/ Fill Ratio: 
  -- after loading the how much factor, a new HashSet object will be created. that factor is called
 as Load Factor or Fill Ratio.
